* You are free to use the internet (obviously) and any other resources.
* Please use [jupyter](https://jupyter.org/install) notebooks or Google [colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) (```.ipynb``` extension) for the questions in ```ScriptingRecruitments_Coding.pdf```. **Please explain the steps and the chosen variable names clearly**. Name the files ```Q<question number>_Coding.ipynb```.
* There is a folder dedicated for each of the assignments. Put all the files related to a question in its folder. There is a ```README.md``` in each of the folders. Put any comments (about the question) or assumptions that you have made in the corresponding ```README.md``` (It is not necessary to mention anything there - you can leave it blank).
* The deadline for submission is $26^{th}$ February 2023, 11:59 PM. (Don't worry, we will extend the deadline for non-freshies owing to midsems in this time period).
